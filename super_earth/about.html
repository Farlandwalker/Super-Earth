                <p><strong>Assignment of roles to team members:</strong> In this project, team members were assigned different roles based on their skills and interests. Yang Yufei, who was responsible for information collection, focused on the background of the project and data gathering, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the information, while also assisting in some front-end design work. Coordinator Yang Minghao was responsible for coordinating the team’s work, scheduling tasks, ensuring the project progressed on time, and effectively communicating with both internal and external resources. He also assisted other members with coding tasks and page beautification. Meanwhile, Jin Hongyu primarily handled the technical implementation, including coding, solving technical problems, and beautifying the pages.</p>
                <p><strong>Motivating and exciting aspects of the project:</strong> This project has been both challenging and full of motivating and exciting moments. It’s our team’s first opportunity to independently design a website, combining our theoretical knowledge with practice. The project allows us to solve real-world problems, which has been a great way to improve our skills. It has also provided room for creativity, as team members are free to propose new ideas and explore different solutions. This creative process has often energized us. Additionally, seeing the results of our efforts, such as achieving a small goal or solving a technical problem, has greatly boosted our sense of accomplishment and motivated us to keep moving forward.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges faced by the project:</strong> Of course, this project has also presented several challenges. The biggest challenge has been time management, as each member has other academic or work commitments, making it difficult to ensure the project progresses on schedule. Technical difficulties have also been a major challenge, especially when dealing with complex problems during development, which sometimes requires more time and resources than expected. Moreover, communication and coordination within the team has been a challenge, as different members may have different understandings of issues, leading to occasional disagreements. To overcome these difficulties, the team has developed detailed schedules and workflows, held regular meetings to communicate progress, and resolved conflicts to ensure smooth progress and collaboration among members.</p>
